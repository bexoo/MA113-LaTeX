\section{Coordinate Systems and Polar Functions}
\subsection{Rectangular Coordinates}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(x,y)$
    \item Every point has only one set of coordinates
    \item Unique representation!
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Polar Coordinates}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(r,\theta)$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $r$ is the distance from the origin
        \item $\theta$ is the angle the radius faces
    \end{itemize}
    \item Lacks unique representation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can add $2\pi$ to any angle and get the same point
        \item Can make radius negative and add $\pi$ to the angle and get the same point
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
These coordinates are helpful for setting up integrals later.
\subsection{Transformations}
\definition{$\tan{\theta}$ is the distance from the intersection of the extended radius and the vertical tangent to the tangent point.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x^2+y^2=r^2$
    \item $\tan{\theta} = \frac{y}{x}$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $x=0 \implies \theta \in \{\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}\}$
    \end{itemize}
    \eject
    \item $\theta = \tan^{-1}{\frac{y}{x}}$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\tan{\theta}$ is the distance from the intersection of the extended radius and the vertical tangent to the tangent point
        \item This is problematic! Range of arctan is $(\frac{-\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$, so we do not get all $360$ degrees.
        \item $ \theta = \begin{cases}
            \tan^{-1}{\frac{y}{x}} & x\leq 0 \\
            \frac{\pi}{2} & x=0,y>0 \\
            \frac{3\pi}{2} & x=0,y<0 \\
            \tan^{-1}{\frac{y}{x}} + \pi & x < 0
            \end{cases}
        $
    \end{itemize}
    \item $r\cos{\theta} = x$
    \item $r\sin{\theta} = y$
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Polar Graphs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Graphs are of the form $r(\theta)$, $r$ is a function of $\theta$.
    \item $r(\theta) = \cos{\theta}-1$ is a cardioid.
    \item $r(\theta)=\cos{(2\theta)}$ is a $4-$flower.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\cos{(\text{n}\theta)}$ has $2n$ petals if $n$ is even, $n$ petals if $n$ is odd.
    \item $r = \theta$ is the Archimedes spiral.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This can be generalized by $r = a\theta$.
    \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Differentiating Polar Functions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We come to a problem, we wish to find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ but our functions are in terms of $r$ and $\theta$!
    \item $\frac{dy}{dx}$ = $\frac{dy/d\theta}{dx/d\theta}$ by the Chain Rule.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Not because we can cancel out the $d\theta$ terms!
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Chain Rule}
The default way the Chain Rule is portrayed is
\[ \frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f^\prime(g(x)) \cdot g^\prime(x) \text{.} \]
Other notation is
\[ \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{df}{dg} \cdot \frac{dg}{dx} \text{.} \]
The Chain Rule allows us to change variables which we do not wish to differentiate by.
\subsubsection{Polar Derivatives}
Now we can substitute $y$ and $x$ with our earlier transformations to get
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{d}{d\theta}r\sin{\theta}}{\frac{d}{d\theta}r\cos{\theta}} \text{.} \]

\subsection{Arc Lengths}
\subsubsection{Review}
In Calculus II, we learned the arclength of a function from $a$ to $b$ as
\[ \int_a^b{\sqrt{1+(f^\prime(x))^2}dx} \]
This is somewhat related to
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \langle x,f(x) \rangle = \langle 1,f^\prime(x) \rangle \]
\[ || \langle1, f^\prime(x) \rangle || = \sqrt{1+(f^\prime(x))^2} \text{.} \]
Here we are essentially integrating the magnitude of the derivative of the vector, which gives us the arclength (think about this visually with the Pythagorean Theorem).
We can also think of this as ``vectorizing'' the derivative.
\subsubsection{Polar Arc Length}
We want to find the arc length of a function in terms of $r(\theta)$.
\begin{align*}
    s & = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2}{\lVert \frac{d}{d\theta} \langle r\cos{(\theta)}, r\sin{(\theta)} \rangle \rVert d\theta} \\
    & = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2}{|| \langle r^\prime\cos{(\theta)} - r\sin{(\theta)}, r^\prime\sin{(\theta)} + r\cos{(\theta)} \rangle || d\theta} \\
    & = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2}{\sqrt{ (r^\prime\cos{(\theta)} - r\sin{(\theta)})^2+ (r^\prime\sin{(\theta)} + r\cos{(\theta)})^2  } d\theta} \\
    & = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2}{\sqrt{r^2+ (r^\prime)^2}d\theta}
\end{align*}
This is the same as the previous arc length formula, just with substitutions.

\subsection{Polar Area}
We integrate all the sectors of the function, each of which approximates the sector of a circle,
each of which has angle $\Delta \theta$ and radius $r(\theta)$. The area of each sector is
\begin{equation*}
    (\pi r^2)(\frac{\Delta\theta}{2\pi}) = \frac{1}{2}r^2 \Delta\theta.
\end{equation*}
Thus, the total area is
\[
    \frac{1}{2} \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2}{r(\theta)^2 d\theta}.
\]
We can subtract these integrals as needed to find areas between two curves:
\[
    \frac{1}{2} \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2}{r_2(\theta)^2 - r_1(\theta)^2 d\theta}.
\]

\section{Vectors}
\subsection{Fundamentals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The point $A(1,2)$ to the point $B(6,5)$ is denotated as the vector $\overrightarrow{AB} = \langle 6-1,5-2 \rangle = \langle 5,3 \rangle$.
    \item Vectors have magnitude and direction.
    \item Vectors in angle bracket notation are typically assumed to start at the origin.
    \item Arrow hats represent vectors, some books boldface instead.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Column vectors are also used: $\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Adding vectors is the same as adding their components.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Geometrically, we add tail of one vector to the head of another.
        \item Can only add vectors in the same number of dimensions.
        \item $\langle 1,2,0 \rangle + \langle -1,4,8 \rangle = \langle 0,6,3 \rangle$
    \end{itemize}
    \item In subtraction we add the negative of the vector.
    \item Scalar multiplication of a vector is the same as multiplying each component by that scalar.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $3\angled{1,2,0} = \angled{3,6,0}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Norms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Norms are the length or magnitude of a vector
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Notated as $||\overrightarrow{v}||$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item $|| \overrightarrow{v} || = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \dots + r_n^2}$.
    \item $\angled{1,3,2} = \sqrt{14} \angled{\frac{1}{\sqrt{14}},\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},\frac{2}{\sqrt{14}}}$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generally, this is useful because we separate the norm from the direction (unit vector).
        \item General form is $|| \vec{v} || (\frac{\vec{v}}{||\vec{v}||})$.
        \item This is called normalizing a vector.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Special Vectors
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\vec{i} = \angled{1,0,0}$
        \item $\vec{j} = \angled{0,1,0}$
        \item $\vec{k} = \angled{0,0,1}$
        \item Always assume we are in three dimensions (every vector has $0\overrightarrow{k}$).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Dot Product}
The dot product is defined as
\[ \vv{v} \cdot \vv{w} = v_1w_1 + v_2w_2 + \dots + v_nw_n. \]
This has a lot of cool properties, for one: \[\vv{v} \cdot \vv{w} = ||\vv{v}||\,||\vv{w}||.\]
Also, the dot product is commutative and can be distributed.
\begin{exmp}
    $\angled{1,3,2} \cdot \angled{3,0,2} = 3+0+2 = 7$.
\end{exmp}

\subsubsection{Angles in the Dot Product}

Additionally, by the law of cosines on our vector subtraction example, we get:
\begin{align*}
||\vv{v}||^2 + ||\vv{u}||^2 - 2||\vv{u}|| ||\vv{v}|| \cos{\theta} & = ||\vv{v}-\vv{u}||^2 \\
& = (\vv{v}-\vv{u})\cdot(\vv{v}-\vv{u}) \\
& = \vv{v} \cdot \vv{v} - 2 \vv{u} \cdot \vv{v} + \vv{u} \cdot \vv{u}
\end{align*}
Simplifying, we get
    \[\cos{\theta} = \frac{\vv{u} \cdot \vv{v}}{||\vv{u}|| \, ||\vv{v}||}\]
This may also be represented as
\[ ||\vv{u}|| \, ||\vv{v}|| \cos{\theta} = \vv{u} \cdot \vv{v} \]
So, the dot product gives us:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Norms
    \item Angles
    \item Distance (metric)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Projections}
We wish to find the component of one vector $\vv{u}$ onto another vector $\vv{v}$.
This is written as $\text{proj}_{\vv{v}}\vv{u}$, which is the projection of $\vecu$ onto $\vecv$.
This projection will be a scalar multiple of $\vecv$ (the vector we project onto),
which can be represented as $\text{proj}_{\vv{v}}\vv{u} = \alpha \vecv$.
Recall that
\[\cos{\theta} = \frac{\vv{u} \cdot \vv{v}}{||\vv{u}|| \, ||\vv{v}||}.\]
In our case $\theta=90^\circ$, so $\vecu \cdot \vecv = 0$.
Note that $\vecu \perp \vecv \: \iff \: \vecu \cdot \vecv = 0.$
We know that
\begin{align*}
    \alpha \vecv \cdot (\vecu - \alpha \vecv) & = 0 \\
    \vecu & = \alpha \vecv \cdot \vecv \\
    \alpha &= \frac{\vecv \cdot \vecu}{\vecv \cdot \vecv}.
\end{align*}
Therefore,
\[ \text{proj}_{\vecv} \vecu = (\frac{\vecv \cdot \vecu}{\vecv \cdot \vecv})\vecv .\]
A way to remember this is that $\vecv$ is the vector we are projecting onto.

\subsection{Three Dimensions}
We orient our axes by the right hand rule, where the $x$ axis is coming towards us.
\subsubsection{Set Notation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A sphere would be $\{\vecu : \norm{\vecu} = k\}$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $x^2+y^2+z^2=k^2$
    \end{itemize}
    \item A sphere centered at another point would be $\{\vecu: \norm{\vecu-\vv{w}} = k\}$,
where $\vv{w}$ is the vector from the origin to the center of the sphere.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2=k^2$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cross Product}
\begin{definition}
    $\vecv \times \vv{w} = \norm{\vecv} \, \norm{\vv{w}} \sin{\theta} \, \vv{n}$,
    where $\vv{n}$ is a unit vector which satisfies the right-hand rule.
\end{definition}
$n$ must be perpendicular to both vectors $\vecv$ and $\vv{w}$.
Alternatively,
\[  \norm{\vecv \times \vv{w}} = \norm{\vecv} \, \norm{\vv{w}} \, |\sin{\theta}| \]
\subsubsection{Properties}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Not commmuative, can be clearly seen by the right-hand rule, which gives opposite values if we reverse the order.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\vecv \times \vecw = -(\vecw \times \vecv)$
    \end{itemize}
    \item The magnitude of the cross product is the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors.
    \item $\vecv \times (\alpha \vecv) = \angled{0,0,0}$
    \item $\norm{\vecv} \, \norm{\vecw} = \vecv \times \vecw \iff \vecv \perp \vecw.$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This means $\vecv \perp \vecw \iff \vecv \cdot \vecw = 0$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Matrices}
\subsubsection{2 $\times$ 2}
Given a matrix
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
    A & B \\
    C & D
\end{bmatrix}
\]
The determinant of the matrix is $AD - BC$. This is the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors $\angled{A,B}$ and $\angled{C,D}$.
\subsubsection{3 $\times$ 3}
Given a matrix
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
    A & B & C \\
    D & E & F \\
    G & H & I
\end{bmatrix}
\]
We first take $A$ and multiply it by the determinant of the matrix formed by crossing out its row and column (any place a rook could be placed and not hit $A$).
\[ A(EI-FH) \]
Every other term is negative, so we subtract the $B$ term and add the $C$ term, giving us
\[ A(EI-FH) - B(DI-FG) + C(DH - GE) \footnote{We can calulate this easier by expanding by a row (or column) with 0s, we don't always need to do the top row! The process will be the same, and the $+$s and $-$s form a checkerboard pattern.}\] as the determinant of this matrix. This is the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the vectors $\angled{A,B,C}$, $\angled{D,E,F}$ and $\angled{G,H,I}$. This is also known as the triple product, but it is really just
\[\angled{A,B,C} \times \angled{D,E,F} \cdot \angled{G,H,I}\]
\subsubsection{Calculating the Cross Product With Matrices}
To calculate the cross product of $\vecv = \angled{0,1,2}$ and $\vecw = \angled{1,1,3}$ we use the determinant.
\[ \vecv \times \vecw = \det\footnote{This is slightly a misuse of notation, usually we should not have a vector in this matrix.}{(
\begin{bmatrix}
    \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\
    0 & 1 & 2 \\
    1 & 1 & 3
\end{bmatrix})} \]
We can dot the resulting vector with any of our original vectors and we should get $0$, this verifies that our calculation is correct.

\subsection{Parametric Equations}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
Generally, a parametric function is one that takes a variable $t$ and maps it to a point $(x,y,z)$. They are usually used to model the position of moving objects. It can also be thought of as mapping a straight line onto a flexible line in space.
\subsubsection{Some notation things}
Usually we write functions as $y(x) = x^2$, however a more specific notation would be
\[ y:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+ : x \mapsto x^2 \]
This means we have a function $y$ such that it maps real numbers onto positive real numbers, and it maps a value $x$ onto $x^2$.
In this way, we can write a parametric function as
\[ \vv{r} : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3 : t \mapsto  \angled{x(t),y(t),z(t)} \]

\subsubsection{Crossing Sets}
We take the Cartesian product (similar to the cross product) of sets like this.
\[ \{1,2,3\}\times\{a,b\} = \{(1,a),(1,b),(2,a),(2,b),(3,a),(3,c)\} \]
In this same way,
\[ \mathbb{R}^2 = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} .\]
Also,
\[ \mathbb{R}^3 = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} .\]

\subsection{Lines in 3 Dimensions}
Defining lines as $y=mx+b$ does not work in three dimensions, since a line in three dimensions does not have a slope.. Instead, we define lines with a point and a direction.
\[ \vv{r}(t) = \vv{A} + t\vecv \]
where $\vv{A}$ is the origin point of the line and $\vecv$ is the direction of the line, which we can think of as taking the place of the slope. Usually we combine these two terms into a single vector, like
\[ \angled{2-t,1-2t,4-4t} .\]
Alternatively, we may write this as
\begin{align*}
    x(t) & = 2-t \\
    y(t) & = 1-2t \\
    z(t) & = 4-4t.
\end{align*}
The former is the vector form, and the latter equations are parametric equations.

\subsection{Distance Between Line and Point}
We wish the find the distance $d$ between a line and a point. The line is defined by a point $A$ and a vector $\vecv$, and the point is $B$. Let $\theta$ be the angle between the vectors $\vecv$ and $\vv{AB}$. We quickly see that
\[ \sin{\theta} = \frac{d}{\norm{\vv{AB}}} .\]
Now we may see hints of the cross product in here.
\begin{align*}
    d & = \frac{\norm{\vecv}\norm{\vv{AB}}\sin{\theta}}{\norm{\vecv}} \\
     & = \boxed{\frac{\norm{\vv{AB} \times \vecv}}{\norm{\vecv}}}.
\end{align*}

\subsection{Planes}
A plane is defined as, given a point $A$ and a vector $\vecv$ rooted at $A$, the set of all points $P$ such that $\vv{AP} \perp \vecv$, or $\vv{AP} \cdot \vecv = 0$. If we write $A$  and $P$ as vectors, this is equivalent to
\[ \vecv \cdot (\vv{P} - \vv{A}) = 0 \]
Usually, this is multiplied out, and the equation of the plane is written in the form
\[ ax + by + cz = d \]
In this case, the normal vector turns out to be $\angled{a,b,c}.$
\subsubsection{Given Three Points}
When given three points $A,B,C$, we first need to find the normal vector. This can be done by taking $\vv{AB} \times \vv{AC}.$ Then, the rest of the calculation proceeds as shown prior.
